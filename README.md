# instant-ap

Setup your GNU/Linux box as an access point: dumb-proof-easy script + confs

features:

- **minimal**, a single bash script and two very tiny conf files. 

- **minimal requirements**, just dnsmasq and hostapd

- **self-contained**, everything you need in one dir. No need to edit system-wide configurations.

- **init style control script**, with the familiar "start|stop|status" syntax


*USAGE:*

```
# ./instant-ap start
```
